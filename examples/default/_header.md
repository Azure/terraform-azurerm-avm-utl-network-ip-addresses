# Default example

This example demonstrates different ways to use the module, including both traditional CIDR prefix notation and the newer IP address count approach.

## Examples Included

### Traditional CIDR Prefix Approach
- **Efficient vs Inefficient Mode**: Shows how the module can optimize subnet allocation
- **Ordered vs Unordered**: Demonstrates the impact of input ordering on address allocation

### IP Address Count Approach
- **Automatic CIDR Calculation**: Specify the number of IP addresses needed and let the module calculate the optimal CIDR size
- **Efficiency Analysis**: Compare actual vs requested IP addresses to understand space utilization
- **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Direct comparison between IP count and traditional CIDR approaches
